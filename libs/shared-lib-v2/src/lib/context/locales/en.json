Working both directly and through government systems, these programs collectively reach millions of children and young people each year. The direct work follows two tracks: Pratham works with children either in the school or in the community, whereas the “partnership” model involves Pratham teams working closely with government teams at the state, district, or block level. Our unwavering commitment to developing, testing, and improving learning outcomes continues to serve as a model, both within India and beyond.",

                  The Pratham-Shah PraDigi Innovation Centre, also known as
                  PraDigi Centre (India), was established to develop an open
                  learning model designed to foster lifelong learning and equip
                  children and youth with essential skills for school, life, and
                  work. It is an extension of the international Pratham-Shah
                  PraDigi Innovation Centre set up in Pratham USA with anchor
                  support from the Sarva Mangal Family Trust of USA. The centre
                  aims to leverage technology to transform educational
                  experiences and to create engaging, supportive, contextual,
                  and relevant learning environments. It supports this vision
                  through innovations like the Creativity Club program and tools
                  like the AI-powered BaalSakhi chatbot and the recently
                  launched PadhAI app, among others
